# Analyzing Agent Response Attitude in Customer E-commerce Journeys: A Data-driven Approach for Enhanced Customer Satisfaction  

## Project Description

### Project Overview  

The objective of this project was to analyze the response attitude of Agents throughout the customer's E-commerce site journey, starting from their initial interaction to the point of product ordering. The project employed a systematic approach, involving the creation of a dataset through the collection and organization of actual data while assuming the role of dummy customers. The dataset served as the foundation for conducting an in-depth analysis, culminating in the creation of a comprehensive dashboard for result visualization.  

### Data Collection and Organization  

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis, we adopted a data-driven approach. As dummy customers, we actively engaged with the E-commerce site, simulating realistic interactions. Through this process, we systematically collected relevant data points at various stages of the customer journey. These data points were carefully organized and structured to create a comprehensive dataset, which formed the basis of our subsequent analysis.  

### Thorough Analysis and Insights  

Leveraging the meticulously prepared dataset, we performed a rigorous analysis to gain valuable insights into the Agent's response attitude. Our analysis encompassed various dimensions, including the timeliness, effectiveness, and customer-centricity of the Agent's interactions. By scrutinizing the dataset, we identified patterns, trends, and areas of improvement, enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions and make informed recommendations.  

### Result Visualization through a Dashboard  

To facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the findings, we employed data visualization techniques. Through the utilization of advanced tools and technologies, we created an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard presented the analysis results in a visually appealing and easily interpretable format, allowing stakeholders to grasp the key insights at a glance. By visually representing the data, the dashboard served as a powerful communication tool for conveying complex information effectively.  
(The uploaded image file in this repository displays only a portion of the entire dashboard, and for security reasons, other dashboards are not provided.)  

### Conclusion  

The project successfully analyzed the Agent's response attitude throughout the customer's E-commerce site journey, employing a data-driven approach. By assuming the role of dummy customers and collecting actual data, we created a comprehensive dataset that served as the foundation for a thorough analysis. Through the utilization of a well-designed dashboard, we effectively visualized the results, enabling stakeholders to comprehend the findings and make informed decisions. The project's outcomes provide valuable insights into the Agent's performance, offering opportunities for enhancement and improvement in customer satisfaction.

## Project Details  

In this section, we will outline the customer journey from ordering to product delivery, dividing it into two distinct phases: the Pre-Purchase Phase and the Purchase Phase. The Pre-Purchase Phase involves customer inquiries about products and services of interest to the agent before placing an order. On the other hand, the Purchase Phase encompasses customer queries related to ordering, delivery, and post-order support until the product is received. The analysis included a total of 28 dummy customers, each purchasing different products, such as mobile phones, tablets, watches, laptops, monitors, TVs, projectors, refrigerators, ranges, washers, dryers, dishwashers, and other electrical appliances.


### Customer Journey Analysis: Pre-purchase Stage  

* Introduction:  
During the Pre-Purchase Phase, customers were further categorized into two groups: call evaluation and chat evaluation. Each customer interacted with 14 different agents to assess their performance. Throughout the phone calls and chat sessions, customers asked five questions related to their product of interest, evaluating the agent's proficiency as they progressed through the journey until the problem was resolved.

* Evaluation Criteria:  
The table below outlines the evaluation criteria utilized during the Purchase Stage.

### Customer Journey Analysis: Purchase Stage  

* Introduction:  
This section focuses on the Purchase Stage, where customers exclusively interacted with agents through chat and evaluated their abilities. Within this stage, the company's departments were divided into ePromoter and Order Support. All customers evaluated agents from both departments, allowing for an assessment of the ePromoter department's effectiveness in transitioning to Order Support seamlessly. During this stage, dummy customers asked questions related to ordering and delivery, received answers, and evaluated the agents' attitude, abilities, and skills until the issues were resolved.
