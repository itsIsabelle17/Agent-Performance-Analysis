# Analyzing Agent Response Attitude in Customer E-commerce Journeys: A Data-driven Approach for Enhanced Customer Satisfaction  

### Project Overview  

The objective of this project was to analyze the response attitude of Agents throughout the customer's E-commerce site journey, starting from their initial interaction to the point of product ordering. The project employed a systematic approach, involving the creation of a dataset through the collection and organization of actual data while assuming the role of dummy customers. The dataset served as the foundation for conducting an in-depth analysis, culminating in the creation of a comprehensive dashboard for result visualization.  

### Data Collection and Organization  

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis, we adopted a data-driven approach. As dummy customers, we actively engaged with the E-commerce site, simulating realistic interactions. Through this process, we systematically collected relevant data points at various stages of the customer journey. These data points were carefully organized and structured to create a comprehensive dataset, which formed the basis of our subsequent analysis.  

### Thorough Analysis and Insights  

Leveraging the meticulously prepared dataset, we performed a rigorous analysis to gain valuable insights into the Agent's response attitude. Our analysis encompassed various dimensions, including the timeliness, effectiveness, and customer-centricity of the Agent's interactions. By scrutinizing the dataset, we identified patterns, trends, and areas of improvement, enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions and make informed recommendations.  

### Result Visualization through a Dashboard  

To facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the findings, we employed data visualization techniques. Through the utilization of advanced tools and technologies, we created an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard presented the analysis results in a visually appealing and easily interpretable format, allowing stakeholders to grasp the key insights at a glance. By visually representing the data, the dashboard served as a powerful communication tool for conveying complex information effectively.

### Conclusion  

The project successfully analyzed the Agent's response attitude throughout the customer's E-commerce site journey, employing a data-driven approach. By assuming the role of dummy customers and collecting actual data, we created a comprehensive dataset that served as the foundation for a thorough analysis. Through the utilization of a well-designed dashboard, we effectively visualized the results, enabling stakeholders to comprehend the findings and make informed decisions. The project's outcomes provide valuable insights into the Agent's performance, offering opportunities for enhancement and improvement in customer satisfaction.

## Detailed Project Description  

In this section, we will outline the customer journey from ordering to product delivery, dividing it into two distinct phases: the Pre-Purchase Phase and the Purchase Phase. The Pre-Purchase Phase involves customer inquiries about products and services of interest to the agent before placing an order. On the other hand, the Purchase Phase encompasses customer queries related to ordering, delivery, and post-order support until the product is received. The analysis included a total of 28 dummy customers, each purchasing different products, such as mobile phones, tablets, watches, laptops, monitors, TVs, projectors, refrigerators, ranges, washers, dryers, dishwashers, and other electrical appliances.


### Customer Journey Analysis: Purchase Stage  

* Introduction:  
During the Pre-Purchase Phase, customers were further categorized into two groups: call evaluation and chat evaluation. Each customer interacted with 14 different agents to assess their performance. Throughout the phone calls and chat sessions, customers asked five questions related to their product of interest, evaluating the agent's proficiency as they progressed through the journey until the problem was resolved.

* Evaluation Criteria:  
The table below outlines the evaluation criteria utilized during the Purchase Stage.  
  * Call:
  
| Category | Sorting Category | Measurement Details |  
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------- |  
|**Response Rate**| Active Listening, Knowledge | Ability of agent to accurately acknowledge and understand the reason for call |  
| **Response Accuracy** | Active Listening, Knowledge | Accuracy of agent response compared to official published information |  
| **Response Number** | Active Listening, Knowledge | Total number of questions answered by agent out of 5 questions |

| **Proper Hold** | Performance Skills | Ask Permission and have hold music (vs silence). Agent should come back and check customer every 2 mins |
| **Call to Hold Ratio** | Performance Skills | Total hold time Vs. total duration of call |
| **Total Call Duration** | Performance Skills | Total time spent calling |
| **Total Hold Duration**| Performance Skills | Total amount of time the agent was on hold during the call |
| **Hold Number**| Performance Skills | The number of times the agent held |
| **Evaluator Statisfaction(ES)**| Evaluator Statisfaction | Overall satisfaction by evaluator considering every aspect of the evaluation as a real customer |
