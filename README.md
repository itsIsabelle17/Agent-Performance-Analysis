# Agent-Performance-Analysis
This project involves analyzing the Agent's response attitude from the customer's E-commerce site journey to product ordering. I assumed the role of dummy customers, collected and organized actual data to create a dataset. Based on this dataset, I conducted a thorough analysis and visualized the results by creating a dashboard.
